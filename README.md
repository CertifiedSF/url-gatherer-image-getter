# url-gatherer-image-getter

The program gathers URLs specified with a regex to a new text file (Cleaner to look at) and then downloads the images from those URLs. 
I made this for myself as I wanted to download a bunch of images, and thought this might be good practice because I'm not very experienced.
For that reason, I didn't test it for any other kind of URL or anything. It did do what I wanted for me, but I cannot guarantee everyone else the same experience.
Added to github so I can follow what I have made.

The code file has some description on how it works.
